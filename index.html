            <p>If you haven't been living under a rock for the past 11 years, you've probably heard about Bitcoin a few times right now.
             <b><br><br> "It's magic internet money"
             <br> "It's money for criminals"
             <br> "It's wasting all our energy"
             <br> "It's going to zero" 
             <br> "It's a ponzi scheme" <br><br></b>
             That's what most people would answer if they got asked about Bitcoin.
             All these answers sound very negative and mysterious. The reason for this is that most people don't have a clue what Bitcoin is. They hear about it in the news and make up their mind, without doing their own research. They assume that the media is always right, because why wouldn't they? Let me tell you something: All these famous tv anchors and reporters don't have any idea either, just like you, what Bitcoin is all about. 
             Their mission is to generate views and clicks. Actually telling the truth rarely increases the amount of clicks they get, so they don't bother doing it.
             <br><br>Luckily there exist some very sincere and knowledgeable people on the internet, from whom i've been learning about Bitcoin for the past 2 years. These people are heavily invested in Bitcoin, so they are financially incentivized to understand what it is. With this website I want to formulate a better and more truthful
             answer to the question: "What Is Bitcoin?" 
             After reading the page, I hope you'll start to have a better understanding of why it is that Bitcoin is such a big deal.<br>

            <h1>Why Was Bitcoin Invented?</h1>
            <p>
                To better grasp the many reasons why Bitcoin is such an innovative phenomenon, you need an idea of why Bitcoin was invented and which problems it aims to solve. The important thing I want you to take away from this section is that Bitcoin was never built to enable cheap and fast online payments. Don't get me wrong, when the time is ready, Bitcoin will unlock new innovations for payments that we couldn't imagine were possible. But for now the current payment processors work just fine. The real reason why Bitcoin was invented is to offer an alternative to the current financial system.<br><b>It's aiming to remove the trust required in central banks and give the power back to the people.</b>
                <br><br><i>"Bitcoin is not a revolution for payments, It's a revolution for money"</i>
                <br><br>
                Bitcoin aims to give back power to the people by completely changing how money works. In essence, money is just a ledger that holds information about who owns how much. In our current financial system both the reading and writing access to this ledger is in the hands of the banks and the government. In my opinion, it's time that people start asking some questions: Why do we need a single entity with complete control over the money supply? Why should a bank be able to decide with who I can and with who I cannot transact?  Why aren't we free to choose the money we want to save and transact in? Throughout the past there have been some other attempts at creating digital money, but the government shut them all down to protect their financial monopoly.<br><b>Money is a way of communicating, and everyone should be free to decide with who to talk, what to say, and what language to use.</b>  
                <br><br>
                Bitcoin was invented to provide an alternative to the centralized financial system we live in today. It removes the trust required in central entities. It redistributes power, less for the elite, more for the people. If you want to understand how Bitcoin allows us to have money that's not controlled by anyone, I highly recommend you to dive into the resources listed below.

            <h1>What Is Bitcoin?</h1>
            <p>The coming sections will introduce you to some different approaches at answering the question: "What Is Bitcoin?". As you'll come to see, Bitcoin is relevant to a lot of different aspects of life. It doesn't matter if you are an Economist, Computer Scientist, Investor, Environmentalist, Goldbug, Human Rights Activist,... Bitcoin is for everyone. I hope you resonate with at least one the approaches, and as a result start falling down the <i>Bitcoin Rabbit Hole</i>. Beware, the hole is deep!

            <h1>Bitcoin is Better Money</h1>
            <p>Money is one part of every transaction. Everyone uses money on a daily basis, yet only a few people have asked themselves: "What is Money?"
                <br><br>We spend most of our time and energy at work, in exchange for money at the end of each month. When you think about it in this way, money is just a way of storing energy and time. 

                <br>Anything that's scarce and hard to produce is valuable to us. Our mother and father are so important to us, because we only have one of each. That necklace you received from your grandma ten years ago is so precious to you, because it is unique. The air you breathe is free, because it is abundant. But when you're drowning in a pool, suddenly a little bit of air becomes priceless. It becomes clear very quicky that <b>scarcity equals value</b>. 
                
                <br><br>What's one thing that nobody can create more of, yet everyone wants more of? It's time. Time is the scarcest asset we know of today. No matter how much money someone has, it is impossible to live forever. Everyone  has a limited set of days on this earth. If we could buy an extra year of life, the price of this year would be unimaginably high.
                
                <br><br>When you are working, you're essentially trading your valuable and limited time for money. This money used to be backed by gold, meaning there was a limit on how much could be created. Back then you were trading two scarce items, which makes sense. But these days, money is backed by nothing and can be created out of thin air by governments and central banks all over the world. Increasing the money supply, diminishes the value that each individual unit of that money represents. So by printing more money, its value is decreasing.  As you're storing your time and energy in this money, <b>central banks are essentially stealing your time and effort by increasing the money supply.</b>
                <br><br> <img class="textimage" src="images/dollarvalue.png">
                
                <br><br>In essence, we are trading our time, which is strictly limited, for a money that can be printed out of thin air with no cost or effort. Does this seem like a good deal?  I don't think so. This is where people started looking for alternatives.
                
                <br>People are looking for assets that are costly to create, so they can be sure their part of the total wealth stored in this asset remains about the same. Three obvious options that possess this 'unforgeable costliness' are real estate and stocks. It is no wonder that since the activation of the money printer a lot of value started flowing into these assets, as these are two of the very few options to protect your wealth.
                <br><br><img class="textimage" src="images/homeprices.png"><img class="textimage" src="images/sp500.png">
                <br><br>
                A lot of people have benefited greatly from this, but it is not for everyone. The majority of the world population can't afford a house or don't have the knowledge/time to become an expert in the stock market. 
                <br><br>These people need another alternative. 
                <br><b>These people need Bitcoin, they just don't know it yet.</b>
                <br><br>Bitcoin is often called digital gold, because for both, mining is the only way to increase its supply. But when you compare gold and Bitcoin, the winner is clear. 
                <br><br>Every year, the supply of gold increases by about 2 percent. But what if the price of gold started ricing exponentially? A lot of new mining businesses would be created, driving up the supply, diminishing the value of each unit of gold. And what if we discovered a way to mine the seabottom, or even other planets, for gold? Gold would lose a big part of it's scarcity, and your stored time and energy would lose a big part of its value. 
                <br><br>With Bitcoin, the scarcity is set in stone. There will never be more then 21 million bitcoins, it's just not gonna happen. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, made this possible by using a beautiful mechanism: "The Difficulty Adjustment". As more and more miners enter the space, you would expect the supply growth to increase, as with gold. As miners turned off their machines, you would expect the supply growth to decrease, as with gold. Well, you couldn't be more wrong. Due to the difficulty adjustment, the amount of new bitcoins issued every day is indifferent to the amount of miners. It just becomes more difficult or more easy to mine new units, depending on the amount of active miners.
                <br><br>As a bonus feature, every four years, the amount of bitcoin that gets added to the supply everyday is cut in half. This event is called "The Halving", it will take place until the amount cannot be divided anymore. At this moment, somewhere around 2140, the supply will have reached the magical amount of 21 million. Bitcoin is as scarce as time, because they are the only two assets on this planet with a fixed supply.
                <br><br> <img class="textimage" src="images/bitcoin-inflation-chart.png">
                <br><br>
                <br>By now, I hope you understand that money is a way of storing your time. Your time is scarce, and therefore valuable. Not even Billionaires like Steve Jobs were able to buy themselves extra time, because it is priceless. When you go to work, you're exchanging money for time. You are trading your most valuable asset, your time, for something that can be created out of thin air at absolutely no cost. More and more people started to realize that this trade is not fair. They were being robbed of their time.
                As a consequence, the money started flowing into scarce assets like stocks, real estate and gold. Unfortunately these assets are not for everyone, they have their downfalls, and they are not as limited in supply as time. This is why Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin is the best storage mechanism for your limited time. 
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin has a fixed supply.</b>
                <br><br><b>Because your part of the total wealth will remain stable over time.</b> 
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin is for everyone.</b>

            <h1 class="big">Bitcoin is a Human Right</h1>
            <p>Throughout the last decade, the internet has become part of our daily lives. Most of our actions are somehow connected to an app or website, accessible through the cloud. Every action generates a tiny bit of information about us that will be stored on a central server for years to come. As time passes, these tiny bits of information turn in to one giant pile of personal data that is stored on computers all over the world.
            <br><br>As people realised that all this data could be used to control us and spy on us, they started caring more about it. All over the world, people started deleting their facebook account, enctypting their messages and overall reducing the amount of personal data they left on the internet. 
            <br><br>It's clear that in general, people are very concerned about their online privacy. As they should be, because privacy is a human right. As we further digitize our world, money is becoming more and more digital as well. In countries like Sweden and China the use of cash is almost non existent, almost all payments are made with a smartphone and are thus digital.
            As a result, all of our transactions are now stored on some server or computer somewhere on earth. This collection of transactions is our financial data. As concerned as people are about their online data, as clueless they are about their online financial data. Yet this data contains a lot of information about you. It can reveal what you are interested in, where you are going and when you are shopping. In contrast to our other data, we seem to have no problem handing over
            our financial information to banks and payment processors. 
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmall"src="images/cashless2.jpg">
            <br><br>Digital files can be copied and send to different people multiple times. The same is true for digital money, so we need these third parties that act as a referee to make sure that you can only spend your money once. Third parties provide security while taking away your privacy. When satoshi presented Bitcoin to the world, he provided us with a solution to this problem.
            <br><br>Bitcoin is the invention of digital scarcity. This means that it allows digital money to work without requiring trust in banks as a referee. This trust has been broken too many times.
            <br><br> <i>"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work."</i>
            <br>Satoshi Nakamoto
            <br><br> <b>Bitcoin enables digital money while preserving our privacy.</b>
            <br><br>In its current form, Bitcoin isn't always as private as you might want it to be. But at least it gives us the framework on which private digital money can be enabled. The last few years developers have made a lot of progress towards that goal.
            We're moving into a cashless society, that's inevitable. If it wasn't for Bitcoin, a society like this wouldn't be possible without giving up our privacy. One of our human rights would get taken away for the sake of "progress".
            <br><br>China is a perfect example of how it can go wrong. They have already achieved this cashless society, but not through Bitcoin. All the payments in China are made with their national superapp "Wechat". The enormous amount of data that's gathered in this app is directly available to the chinese government. This has enabled them to implement a social credit system throughout the country with which they control their citizens.
            You're constantly being monitored and one misstep can restrict your access to jobs, loans, insurance and freedom. 
            <br>A cashless society doesn't have to look like the one in china. Bitcoin gives us an alternative future in which our right to privacy is protected.
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmall" src="images/socialcredit.jpg">
            <br><br>Besides giving back our privacy, Bitcoin is also protecting the right to your own things. This right states  that nobody should take our things from us without a good reason.
            Deciding wether something is a good reason or not is very subjective. A good reason for one person is not necessarily a good reason for another person. Therefore it's important that there exists an asset that nobody can take from you, whatever reason they might have. All the assets you think you own, aren't actually yours. If the government doesn't like you it will find a reason for you to give up what you think is yours. If you don't comply they will come and take it. Only when Bitcoin was created have we been exposed to an asset that is truly unconfiscatable. This is because owning Bitcoin is equal to owning a private key. This key is the only thing you need to retain full control over the value stored in your bitcoin. If you choose to write down this key on a piece of paper or store it on a hard drive then it isn't any safer then gold or cash.
            But actually, a private key is just a sequence of 24 words. As long as you can remember these words, you can access your bitcoin. Essentially, this means that you can store value in your brain. Bitcoin allows you to fly to the other side of the planet while carrying a million dollars right inside your mind. As long as you remain silent, nobody will ever be able to take this away from you.
            <br><br>Bitcoin is giving us back control over what is and should be ours. 
            <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin Is Unconfiscatable</b>
            <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin Protects Your Privacy</b>
            <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin Is Freedom</b>

            <p>An economy is a very complex system of interactions between buyers and sellers. Buyers get information from sellers and sellers get information from buyers. This information is presented to them not in words, but in prices. The price of a good determines how much a producer is willing to produce and how much a consumer is willing to consume. But don't get fooled, prices are not only influencing market decisions, this mechanism also works in the opposite direction. Decisions are shaping prices. Prices are an aggregate of all known market information. If demand for a certain good goes up, it's price will follow as more and more money flows towards the good. This results in less money flowing into other products, eventually lowering the prices of these products. Prices are a tool that enables businesses and humans in general to allocate their resources in the most efficient manner.
            <br><br>In the famous piece "I, Pencil", Leonard E. Read beautifully highlights how no single person on earth is capable  of producing a pencil on his own. if you think about it, this makes sense. A lot of resources and cooperation is needed to complete even the simplest of products:
            <br><br>Wood from the trees
            <br>A saw to gather the wood
            <br>Rubber for the eraser, found in the tropics
            <br>Graphite, from the mines in South-America
            <br>Paint to complete the design 
            <br>...
            
            <br><br>

            All these building blocks need to be produced, processed and finally put together to form a pencil. All the cooperation that was needed to complete this complex process was not centrally planned. It is not possible for one single entity to dictate how to allocate resources at every step of the process. Rather this collaboration is made possible by the information contained in the prices of all the needed components.
            There are a lot of companies involved in delivering the necessary components for the pencil. Every single one of these companies uses the price, which is an aggregate of the markets preferences, to deploy its capital in the most efficient way.
            <br><br>By now it should be clear how vital of a role that prices play in the economy, and how no single entity could gather enough information to centrally plan the economy. This task is much better handled by a free and organic system of prices. This is were our money fucks up everything, prices are not free nor organic. Prices should perfectly represent supply and demand, going up when demand increases or supply decreases, going down when supply increases or demand decreases. But in reality, prices are distorted by central banks because they have complete power over
            the money printer. The supply of money can be increased and decreased (although this rarely happens) as they wish. What's the modern solution for a recession? Print Money. What to do when inefficient companies go broke? Print Money. It is believed that by printing money the economy can be saved, without considering the way this distorts our pricing system.
            <br><br>When the supply of money changes, so do our prices. When you increase the amount of something, it's value decreases, as explained in previous sections. Prices of products and services are expressed in a currency with a varying supply. As a consequence these prices no longer reflect the preferences of the market, but become rather a function of how much the money supply is being manipulated.
            <br><br>
            Coordination between companies is based on the information provided by these prices, but as this information gets tampered with, the cooperation relying on it breaks down. Imagine a good with a very stable supply and demand, in normal circumstances the price of this good would be stable and businesses could allocate their capital based on it.  But now what happens when the money supply gets artificially inflated? The price goes up, signalling an increase in demand to the producers, causing them to ramp up production. This will result in a surplus of the good, which lowers the profits the company in question makes. The problem with this should be clear: There never was an actual increase in demand, however through the manipulation of the money supply just it seemed like there was. 
            As all prices in our economy are denominated in the same manipulated currency, all market information loses its meaning. As companies lose the signals they need in order to allocate their resources efficiently, everything starts falling apart. 
            <br><br>In most parts of the world, like Europe and America, the money supply is increased at a relatively slow pace. This doesn't distort the price signals significantly in the short term. But if you take a look at countries like Venezuela, it becomes clear how important a stable money supply is. Even though they are blessed with huge amounts of natural resources, their economy has completely collapsed since the government started printing money at an astronomical pace. Shelves all across the country are empty and people are starving, all because efficient coordination between suppliers and producers is not possible anymore.
            You should be aware, because this can happen in every country where government controls the money supply, yours included.
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmall"src="images/emptyshelves.jpg">
            <br><br>This is where Bitcoin comes to the rescue. As you have come to understand by now, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million units. This means that nobody can manipulate it, essentialy providing us with prices that cannot be manipuated, assuming that Bitcoin was used a Unit Of Account.If you think about it, using a currency of which the supply constantly changes is like using a ruler of which the length constantly changes. It's impossible to do efficient claculations with it because you cannot compare measurements through time. Imagine building a house with such a ruler, it wouldn't be easy!
            This is exactly the reason why we have invented standardized measurement units for weight, length, time, temperature ... 
            <br><br><img class="textimageSmallNoBorder" src="images/si_units.png">
            <br><br>Wouldn't it be logical to have a stable measuring stick for value? Yes it would be, but since our currencies have been manipulated for such a long time, we have forgotten how useful this can be. 
            <br><br><b>This is why we need Bitcoin </b>
            <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin enables the most efficient allocation of resources</b>
            <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin is a measuring stick for value</b>

            <h1 class="big">Bitcoin Is The Currency Of The Internet</h1>
            <p> As Technology is evolving exponentially, the world is becoming more and more connected. The internet acts as a second reality for a lot of younger people. It enables us to chat with friends, watch our favourite tv series, attend zoom meetings for work, play  games, consume the news, and so much more. Data has become digital and therefore it can now be transferred instantly to anywhere in the world. This is enabling a much more productive and convenient life for many of us.  
                <br><br>
                I want you to think about something: Why is it that I can stream a video directly to the other side of the planet with almost no latency or cost, yet when I try to do the same thing with money it takes "3-5 business days" and costs me 5% in fees. This doesn't make sense, and the only reason this evolution hasn't taken place for money is because banks have created a monopoly over our money. In the process of protecting their power they are introducing excessive laws and regulations to kill the competition. Until 2009, there had never been invented an alternative form of money that couldn't be stopped by the government. But then came Bitcoin. We are now eleven years later later and they still have not managed to
                stop it, because Bitcoin is unstoppable. 
                <br><br>
                Bitcoin will make possible the same things for money that the internet made possible for data. It allows you to send any amount of money to any person on earth, not caring about location, age, gender, background or anything else. Sending money will become as easy as sending a text message or uploading a video to youtube. They way we think about payments will shift dramatically. 

                <br><br>Paying for netflix won't be a monthly subscription anymore, instead of this, a stream of money will start flowing in to the wallet of Netflix as soon as you start watching your favourite tv show. The moment you decide to stop watching, the stream will be stopped. Monthly subscriptions for digital content will be replaced by streams of money that get initiated as soon as you start consuming. This concept of streaming money can be applied to Netflix, News Sites, Mobile Data and even Electricity... Money will no longer be owned by humans exclusively, machines and computers will be able to transact as well. Just imagine a future in which self driving taxis visit the gas station on their own and get filled up by a robot, picking up the their next customer afterwards. These events would require transactions between computers. This is only possible with Bitcoin as it allows anyone or anything to create a wallet and start receiving and sending transactions immediately without having to provide any personal data. 
                <br><br><img class="textimageSmall" src="images/internetofmoney.jpg"> 
                <!--<br><br>Gaming is becoming a bigger part of our lives, especially within the younger generations. As we know, It is very common for games to offer the player "in game currency" with which he can buy items, skins, weapons in the game itself. The problem with these "game coins" is that every game uses different coins that are not compatible with each other. Although putting real money into a game may be quite easy, converting the "in game currency" back to "real life currency" or into another game is almost never possible. With Bitcoin things will be differentas it has the potential to become the unique currency used in every game. The difference between "in game currency" and "real life currency" would disappear completely. 
                This would allow players to withdraw their game tokens with ease and directly transfer them into other games or use them in a real shop or restaurant. Effectively enabling a seamless process of compensating gamers for their perfromances. Whilst e-sports is already evolving rapidly into one of the most lucrative industries in the world, Bitcoin could accelarate this evolution even more. -->
                <br><br>The internet has evolved the way we consume information. As long as you have a smartphone and an internet connection all the data in the world is available right at your fingertips. This data is delivered to you in real-time with no cost.
                The communication of value, enabled by money, has not yet gone through such an evolution, because banks don't allow it too. But thanks to Bitcoin it will be as easy to send money over the internet as it is to send a picture or video today. Machines will be able to do financial transactions without the authorization of humans whatsoever. We are not yet capable of understanding all the new applications that this innovation will enable, just as almost nobody predicted 50 years ago that the internet would completely change our lives.<br><b>Bitcoin is the logical next step in the digitalisation of the world</b>
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin can be used by anyone or anything</b>
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin changes the way we communicate value</b>
                <br><br><b>Because Bitcoin was born on the internet</b>

            <h1 class="big">Bitcoin Is The Best Performing Asset In The World</h1>
            <p> If you've ever considered investing in Bitcoin it probably started with you looking up a chart of its price. Depending on your timing, you may come to the concusion that the price of one Bitcoin has lost almost 50 percent of its value over the past few months. This seems like the worst investment you've ever seen, so you start asking your friends for advice. They'll tell you that it's a bubble and that it is too volatile. This conforms with the very little research you have done and thus you decide not to invest a single penny. The next month, you see the price go down another 20 percent. You think to yourself: "Wow, I'm so happy that I listened to my friends". 
                <br><br> Five years have passed, and by now you've finally saved enough to afford yourself a brand new car. On christmas eve you visit your family and show off your car for which you have been saving so long. The main dish was a great success and now everyone is eagerly waiting for the desert. While you take a sip of your wine, you overhear your uncle babble something about Bitcoin. You want to make sure he doesn't lose any money with this scam so you ask him if he's been investing. To your surprise, he actually is, and he is making money too. Over the past three weeks he doubled his intital investment. Full of disbelief, you tell him to be careful and only invest what he can afford to lose. 
                <br><br>Eventually the family gathering comes to an end and you decide to go to bed. As you drank a little bit too much wine, it's difficult to fall asleep. You pick up your phone and remember the conversation you had with your uncle. You wonder if he was telling the truth and decide to check the price of Bitcoin. You remember it to be around 300 dollars. The site finishes loading and you can't believe your eyes. One Bitcoin is worth 7000 dollars right now, that means the price has increased more than 20x since you last checked it five years ago! You realize that with an initial investment of as little as 1000 dollars, you could've completely paid off that brand new car you bought last month. Instead you had to put aside 250 dollars every month for the past 5 years. This sucks, you wish you would have taken the risk back in the days, instead of listening to your friends. But surely it's too late to start investing right now, the peak has been reached. You decide to regularly update yourself on the price to confirm your thoughts. As you expected the price doesn't increase any further and stays relatively stable. You lose interest and come to the conclusion that you missed your chance. 
                <br>This is a process that a lot of people have went through. When making up their mind about Bitcoin, they all make the same two mistakes:
                <br><br>Concluding that Bitcoin is too risky based on a few months of price action
                <br><br>Thinking that you're too late after a significant price increase
                <br><br>I'm going to show you that this is the wrong way of evaluating Bitcoin as an investment. Bitcoin isn't a "get rich quick scheme", but rather a "get rich slow scheme". The latter sounds a lot less attractive, but at least it can still make you rich. 
                <br><br><br>The first thing you need to do is zoom out. Instead of looking at the price performance over the past weeks or months, have a look at what the price has done over the last few years. Your conclusion will always be the same: It has gone up, a lot.
                <br><br><img class="textimageBig" src="images/bitcoin_4year_return.jpg">
                <br><br>This chart shows you the returns you would have made if you held Bitcoin for a period of four years. If the multiple on the y-axis equals 10, this means that an investment of 100 dollars, that was made four years ago, would now be worth 1000 dollars. The multiple tends to fluctuate around 20, always staying above 5 even during pullbacks. I challenge you to find any asset in the world that comes close to this performance, you won't find it.
                If you look at Bitcoin in comparison to some more common investments, it's clear that there doesn't exist any competition.
                <br><br><img class="textimageBig" src="images/bitcoin_returns.png">
                <br><br>Out of the last 10 years, Bitcoin has been the best performing asset 8 times. Again, if you look at the other assets in the list, the returns of these assets are much smaller. Surely this must be too good to be true? Well as you can see in the table, there were some years in which Bitcoin didn't perform that well. And as expected, during these years it lost a big part of its value. It lost 60% of its value in 2014 and 72% in 2018. It are these big dips that scare people away from Bitcoin.
                <br>Based on these pullbacks that occur every so often, Bitcoin can be considered a very risky asset. While this might be true if you're looking to invest in the short term, as mentioned above, during the bull runs, you can more than make up for the losses you made during the bear markets. 
                <br><br>To quantify the returns of an investment relative to its risk, investors often use the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/sharpe_ratio.asp" target="_blank">Sharpe Ratio</a>. 
                Compared to other assets like stocks, treasury notes and even gold it's obvious that Bitcoin is performing on another level. Even though Netflix, Apple and Amazon all have similair risk to Bitcoin, their potential returns are way lower. We can conclude that although the volatitlity in the price of Bitcoin can be quite crazy, compared to the returns it offers it is a very small tradeoff.
                <br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1221114618925527040?s=20" target="_blank"><img class="textimageBig" src="images/riskreturn.jpg"></a>
                <br><br>Furthermore, Bitcoin can be a great addition to almost any portfolio. Investors and portfolio managers are always looking for a way to remove risk from their portfolios. They often do this by aqcuiring assets that are uncorrelated to the assets they currently own. This not an easy task since there are a lot of assets that are completely depending on the state of the economy for their returns. One option to hedge your portfolio against a downturn in the economy has always been gold. As we're speaking Bitcoin is setting itself up to accompany gold in this role. If you look at the data below, Bitcoin shows very little correlation with other assets. This means that it could be a very useful tool to generate returns when all other assets are failing to do so. As more and more professional investors come te realize this, Bitcoin will get included in almost every portfolio.
                <br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1201477183815999489?s=20" target="_blank"><img class="textimageBig" src="images/correlation.jpg"></a>
                <br><br>If you're being really critical, you might still point out that past performance does not guarantee future performance. While this is a correct statement to make, there has been done a lot of research to generate a model that predicts how the price of Bitcoin will evolve. Out of this research the 'Stock-to-Flow Model' was born. 
                <br><br>This model has found a statistically significant relationship between the price of Bitcoin and its stock-to-flow ratio. The stock of an asset is equal to the existing supply, the flow represents how much of it is produced over a period of one year. If you calculate the ratio of these two values, you're left with the time it will take for the supply to double given a constant flow. The larger the ratio, the more scarce the asset. As time passes, the flow of Bitcoin will get smaller and smaller until all Bitcoins are mined, then it becomes zero. 
                Using this knowledge, you can calculate that the stock-to-flow ratio of Bitcoin will converge to infinity over time. The stock-to-flow model provides us with an idea of what price can be expected at a certain stock-to-flow ratio. As the S2F ratio is known far in to the future, we can use it to predict price performace. According to the model, Bitcoin could reach a price of 1 million dollars before the end of this decade. Keep in mind that while the relationship between the S2F ratio and the price may be statistically significant, it still doesn't guarantee that the model is correct, neither should you use it to do exact price predictions. For a more in depth overview of the model please read the article <i>"Modeling Bitcoin Value With Scarcity"</i> listed in the resources.

                <br><br>Since its conception, Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset on the planet. While no one has a crsytal ball, The chances that Bitcoin's price will continue to increase over the long term are relatively high.

            <h1 class="big">Bitcoin Is Good For The Environment</h1>
            <p> One of the most frequently used arguments against Bitcoin is that it wastes energy that could be used for a better purpose. This section is dedicated to rebutting that argument.

                <br><br>Bitcoin uses a lot of energy, this cannot be denied, but so do a lot of other things. If you are opposed to Bitcoin for this reason,  
                you should never again put up a christmas tree with lights in it. Because in the US alone, christmas lights are responsible for 6.6 billion kilo watt hours of electricity every year. That's more then the entire national energy consumption of some countries. Indeed, there are many activities that require great amounts of electrity, but we justify this cost because these activities are deemed useful or entertaining. So once you start understanding that sound money is valuable, you'll realise that Bitcoin is worth the energy because of the benefits it brings to society.
                
                
                <br><br>Bitcoin was born out of the financial crisis to offer an alternative for the failing financial system. A system that requires huge amounts of electricty to power banks, monetary policy research, money transport services, ATMs, payments processors and much more. While the complete Bitcoin infrastructure can be powered by a network of computers and smartphones. In a world with Bitcoin as its reserve currency, all of the national currencies and their energy hungry infrastructure would become obsolete. Energy usage would be reduced drastically.

            <p><i>“Imagine if the population were to discover, through real life experience, what it is to conduct their lives with a currency that does not lose its value, but in reality gains in value. As our economy grows and as our manufacturing capabilities increase, prices go down. The only reason that prices are not going down today—except in products where improvements are very rapid (e.g., computers) is because of government-caused currency inflation.”</i>
